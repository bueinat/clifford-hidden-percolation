Code and data used to produce the results in the paper "Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus" ([link to arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211)).

In the widget directory, there is a notebook which illustrates the simplification process of ZX-calculus. These are accessible by pressing the button below.
